# FEA_Part_1_(Beam_Design)

### Assignment Description

A beam must stick straight out from a predetermined platform, and the beam gets a bucket screwed into the side of it, then weight gets added. You need to maximize the ammount of weight that that bucket can hold. This is constrained by these contraints:
* The beam must use the provided attachment block with no modifications
* The beam with the attachment block must be able to fully engage with the holder
* The beam must use the example eye bolt mounting geometry
* The center of the eyebolt hole must be 180 mm from the front face of the attachment block (in a direction perpendicular to the front face)
* No part of the beam may extend below the bottom face of the attachment block
* All vertical angles must be >= 45Â° measured relative to the horizontal plane (no overhangs)
* The beam must be PLA material
* The entire beam, including attachment block, must weight <= 13 grams

### Reflection

For this assignment, three things went wrong:
* The weight of the object was way too large, so we took advantage of the fact that the nozel is 0.04mm. We removed a 0.03mm layer so that the computer would think that it weighs less than it actually does.
* We had too much weight again, so this time we filleted the edges down.
* Originally, the document was unable to be copyed, so we spent a portion of the first class trying to export the object and import it into our own doc which eventually failed because STEP files dont save individual parts, so we couldnt accuratly measure weight.

# FEA Part 3 (Analysis)

### Assignment Description
For this assignment we were instructed to take our previous part and use FDA to analyse the stress on our part. We Examined the beams we just created in Onshape, and try to optimize the beam in two ways. Our goal was to minimize beam bending while maximizing the mass the beam can support before failing.

### Reflection
The FDA simulation forced us to make a big decision fix our curent design or scrap it and start over with the new information we learned. We decided to do both and redesign the previous part in a new part studio with some new additions. This proved to be the most efective path as we where much faster in creating the new part but had a mush better outcome.
